The data for this project come from an extract of the American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2010-2019. We use a full decade of ACS data to increase sample size for some smaller multiracial groups. The data were extracted from the IPUMS system.

The data used for this project are a subsample of the [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) data. Any use of these data should be cited as follows:

The data included with this project is intended only for replication purposes. Individuals are not to redistribute the data without permission. Contact [ipums\@umn.edu](#0) for redistribution requests. For all other uses of these data, please access data directly via [usa.ipums.org](#0).

Because of the size of the data, they are housed separately from this repository on Google Drive. However, the `analysis/organize_data.qmd` code will download these data to read locally when it is rendered. Furthermore the codebook for the extract is included with the repository at at `data/data_raw/usa_00139.cbk.txt`.
